## 1. üìÜ Introduction

Urban parking lots experience demand fluctuations throughout the day. Static pricing does not account for real-time factors like traffic, queue length, or nearby competition, leading to inefficiencies.

This report outlines the development of a **real-time dynamic pricing system** that adjusts parking prices based on historical and real-time factors.

## 2. üî¨ Dataset Overview

- **Locations:** 14 urban parking lots
- **Duration:** 73 days
- **Sampling:** 18 time points/day (8:00 AM - 4:30 PM)
- **Features:**
  - Latitude & Longitude
  - Capacity & Occupancy
  - Queue Length
  - Incoming Vehicle Type (Car/Bike/Truck)
  - Nearby Traffic Level
  - Special Day Indicator

## 3. üí° Pricing Models

### 3.1 Baseline Linear Model
- **Logic:** Price increases linearly with occupancy.
- **Formula:**
  ```
  Price(t+1) = Price(t) + Œ± * (Occupancy / Capacity)
  ```
- **Purpose:** Serve as a simple baseline.

### 3.2 Demand-Based Pricing Model
- **Features Used:**
  - Occupancy / Capacity
  - Queue Length
  - Traffic Level
  - Special Day (binary)
  - Vehicle Type (weighted)

- **Demand Function:**
  ```
  Demand = Œ± * (Occupancy / Capacity) + Œ≤ * QueueLength - Œ≥ * Traffic + Œ¥ * SpecialDay + Œµ * VehicleType
  ```

- **Price Calculation:**
  ```
  Price = BasePrice * (1 + Œª * NormalizedDemand)
  ```

- **Constraints:**
  - Price bounded between 0.5x and 2x of Base Price.
  - Smooth price transitions.

### 3.3 Competitive Pricing Model
- **Additional Factors:**
  - Geographical proximity of nearby lots.
  - Competitor prices.

- **Logic:**
  - If nearby lots are cheaper ‚Üí lower price or suggest rerouting.
  - If nearby lots are expensive ‚Üí increase price while staying competitive.

## 4. üîß Performance Issue with Competitive Pricing Model

### Problem:
The competitive pricing model suffers from slow performance due to nested loops performing expensive distance calculations for each lot pair. This results in O(N¬≤) complexity.

### Optimized Solutions:
- **Spatial Indexing (KDTree):** Improve distance lookup time to O(log N).
- **Parallel Processing:** Use multiprocessing to split the workload.
- **Distance Matrix:** Calculate distances once using `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist` and reuse them.
- **Sampling Strategy:** Run competitive pricing on small data samples for faster iterations.

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Phase 1:** Quick fix - skip competitive pricing temporarily.
2. **Phase 2:** Implement distance matrix and sampling(Requires scikit-learn for Optimized Output).
3. **Phase 3 (Advanced):** Add KDTree and parallelization for production-level performance(Requires scikit-learn).

## 5. üìä Feature Engineering

- **Normalized Occupancy:** Occupancy / Capacity.
- **Traffic Levels:** Standardized across time periods.
- **Vehicle Type Weights:** Assigned based on parking space usage.
- **Demand Normalization:** Applied Min-Max normalization to keep demand in a bounded range.

---

## 6. üìä Results Summary

- Baseline Model showed a basic upward trend with occupancy.
- Demand-Based Model showed more reactive and contextual pricing.
- Competitive Pricing allowed for smart adjustments based on nearby lots, once optimized.

**Visualization:** Real-time price curves and competitor comparisons were generated using Bokeh.

---

## 7. üîç Assumptions

- Base price = $10 for all lots.
- Maximum price variation capped at 2x Base Price.
- Nearby lot distance threshold of ~500 meters for competitive analysis.
- Traffic & Special Day impacts are linear and additive in the demand function.

---

## 8. üî¨ Limitations & Future Work

### Limitations
- Simple linear demand formulation.
- No user-level behavioral modeling.
- Static feature weights without optimization.

### Future Improvements
- Learn optimal feature weights using historical data.
- Add surge pricing for peak periods.
- Integrate rerouting recommendations in the dashboard.
- Build automated model retraining pipelines.
