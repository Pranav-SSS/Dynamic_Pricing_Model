# 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

Capstone Project for **Summer Analytics 2025**  
Organized by the **Consulting & Analytics Club × Pathway**

---

## 📖 Problem Statement

Urban parking lots face fluctuating demand, but static pricing fails to optimize space utilization.  
This project builds a **real-time dynamic pricing engine** that adjusts parking prices based on:

- Lot occupancy
- Queue lengths
- Traffic congestion
- Special events
- Competitor prices
- Vehicle type

## 🔨 Architecture Flow

### ⛳ **Overall Workflow:**

1. **Data Simulation:**
   - Real-time parking data streamed through **Pathway**.
   - Time-stamped events: occupancy, queue, traffic, special days, etc.

2. **Real-Time Data Ingestion:**
   - Pathway dynamically ingests incoming data in chronological order.

3. **Pricing Engine:**
   - **Model 1:** Baseline linear pricing based on occupancy.
   - **Model 2:** Demand-based pricing using multiple features.
   - **Model 3:** Competitive pricing based on nearby lot prices and geospatial data.

4. **Real-Time Visualization:**
   - Prices visualized in real-time via Bokeh dashboards.

## 🧠 Model Details

### Model 1: Baseline Linear Model
> Price ∝ Occupancy / Capacity  
Simple linear relationship:  
```
Price(t+1) = Price(t) + α * (Occupancy / Capacity)
```

### Model 2: Demand-Based Model
Multivariate demand function based on:
- Occupancy rate
- Queue length
- Traffic congestion
- Special events
- Vehicle type

Example:
```
Demand = α * (Occupancy / Capacity) + β * QueueLength - γ * Traffic + δ * SpecialDay + ε * VehicleType
Price = BasePrice * (1 + λ * NormalizedDemand)
```

### Model 3: Competitive Pricing Model (Advanced)
- Adjust prices based on competitor parking lots using distance and price difference.
- If nearby lots are cheaper and available → decrease price.
- If nearby lots are expensive → increase price.

## 🚀 Setup & Run

### Prerequisites
